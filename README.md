# Jovo Web Starter: Chat Widget

Fully customizable open source chat widget that can be integrated into your web app or website.

This repository contains:
* `app`: Backend logic built with the [Jovo Framework](https://github.com/jovotech/jovo-framework) using its [Web Platform integration](https://github.com/jovotech/jovo-framework/tree/master/jovo-platforms/jovo-platform-web).
* `client`: Frontend built with Vue.js and Tailwind CSS, communicating with the backend using the [Jovo Web Client for Vue.js](https://github.com/jovotech/jovo-framework/tree/master/jovo-clients/jovo-client-web-vue).

## Getting started

1. Run `npm install`. This will install the dependencies in both `app` and `client`

2. Go into the `client` directory and run `npm run serve` to start the frontend

3. Go into the `app` directory and run `jovo run` to start the backend

4. Open the starter in your browser `localhost:8080`
